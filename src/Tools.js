        <p>If you have ever ridden a bike, you would know that the freedom it allows is unparalleled.</p>
         <p>The wind in your face, the sun on your back and the endless road â€” is something experienced by only those who dare to ride. </p>
         <p>Winters are the best time for road trips as you get to explore snowy hills, highways and plains. </p>
         <p>The feeling of cold mountain air running through your hair is refreshing.</p>
